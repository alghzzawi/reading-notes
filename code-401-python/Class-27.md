# __Graphs__

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

1. Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
2. Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
3. Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
4. Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Directed vs Undirected
### Undirected Graphs
An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

For example, in the graph below, Node C is connected to Node A, Node E and Node B. There are no “directions” given to point to specific vertices. The connection is bi-directional.

The undirected graph we are looking at has 6 vertices and 7 undirected edges.

Vertices/Nodes = {a,b,c,d,e,f}

Edges = {(a,c),(a,d),(b,c),(b,f),(c,e),(d,e),(e,f)}

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

There are many different types of graphs. This depends on how connected the graphs are to other node/vertices.

The three different types are completed, connected, and disconnected.

Complete Graphs
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

Take a close look at each of the vertices in the graph above. Do you notice that each vertex is actually connected to every other node on the graph? That is what makes it a complete graph.

## Acyclic vs Cyclic

In addition to undirected and directed graphs, we also have acyclic and cyclic graphs.

__Acyclic Graph__

An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.

A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.

Here is an example of 3 acyclic graphs:

## Adjacency Matrix

An Adjacency matrix is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix

Each Row and column represents each vertex of the data structure. The elements of both the column and the row must add up to 1 if there is an edge that connects the two, or zero if there isn’t a connection.

This is what an adjacency matrix looks like:

A few things to note from the above:

1. Looking at the graph we are representing, you can see that Vertex A connects to both Vertex D and Vertex C. To show this, we place a 1 in the position of (a,c) and (a,d).
2. We follow this same pattern for the other vertex’s and where they are connected.
3. If there is not an edge/connection between the vertex’s, we represent this by placing a 0 in the appropriate point of the matrix.

a sparse graph is when there are very few connections. a dense graph is when there are many connections

Within an adjacency matrix, an undirected graph will always be symmetric. This is not the case for a directed graph.

## Adjacency List

An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs.

An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

Adjacency lists make it easy to view if one vertices connects to another.

This is what an Adjacency List looks like:

Looking at the original graph that we are representing, we can see that Vertex A has an edge to both Vertex C and Vertex D. As a result, we will place both Vertex C and Vertex D in the adjacency list. Just from observation, we can see that we will only place the vertices that are connected in the list. If there is no connection between the vertices, they are not listed.

Thinking about how we will implement this in code? Well, let’s look at what the visual is telling us.

1. We can visually see that we are working with a collection of some sort. The visual is depicting a Linked List, but you could easily make it an array of arrays if you’d like.
2. Each index or node (depending on the data structure you choose to represent the adjacency list) will be a vertex within the graph.
3. Every time you add an edge, you will find the appropriate vertices in the data structure and add it to the appropriate location.
